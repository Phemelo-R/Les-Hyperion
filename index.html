        <h2>Mapping living landscapes and oceans</h2>
        <p>
          Les&nbsp;Hyperion is a space for exploring southern African land and sea through geographic data.
          The site brings together open satellite products, elevation models, biodiversity records and survey
          layers, and works through them with code to build maps, indicators and simple models. Content is
          organised into three strands—<strong>Terrestrial</strong>, <strong>Marine</strong> and <strong>Methods</strong>—so that
          users can move from broad context maps to focused ecological questions and the workflows that support them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name draws on Hyperion, a Titan in Greek mythology whose name is often translated as
          <em>“he who goes above”</em> or <em>“the one who watches from above.”</em> He is linked to light,
          celestial motion and observation—an obvious parallel to the satellite platforms, aircraft and
          survey systems that now trace energy, structure and movement across Earth’s surface. The prefix
          <em>Les</em> echoes a collective vantage point: a reminder that the work here is not only about
          remote sensing technology, but also about many eyes and instruments building a shared view of
          southern African ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the tools are GIS and remote sensing, the questions are ecological and biological at heart:
          how species and habitats are distributed, how fire and land use reshape them, how ocean conditions
          affect marine communities, and where conservation effort might matter most. Engaging with the site
          should leave you with working examples of code, a clearer sense of available datasets, and a set of
          patterns for turning raw spatial data into ecological insight.

      <h3>South African context</h3>
      <p>
        This interactive map centres on southern Africa and anchors the spatial frame used across the site.
        Use the zoom controls to move between continental scale and local detail in terrestrial and marine
        settings. The basemap responds to the theme toggle, switching between light and dark tiles to match
        your viewing preference.

        <p>
          The site is a static front-end served via GitHub Pages, with all notebooks and scripts stored in
          the <a href="https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/LesHyperion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Les&nbsp;Hyperion
          repository</a>. The navigation links—<em>Terrestrial</em>, <em>Marine</em> and <em>Methods</em>—group
          related work: land-based analyses, ocean-focused material, and cross-cutting workflows. Each entry
          points to a rendered notebook so you can read through the analysis, inspect the maps and figures,
          and trace the code that produced them.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          The geographic focus is southern Africa, across both land and ocean domains. Analyses draw on
          openly licensed datasets such as satellite imagery, digital elevation models, land-cover products,
          protected-area layers and biodiversity records from portals like GBIF. The Methods section highlights
          recurring tasks—data access, cleaning, projections, joining tables to geometries, building simple
          models and visualisations—so that the same techniques can be reused in new ecological and biological
          studies. Contributions, adaptations and issue reports are welcome via GitHub.
